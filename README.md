World-Wide-Weather-App is an interactive, front-end weather application that allows users to explore weather data for major cities around the world.

In this submission, the app has been rebuilt to remove external API dependencies, and instead uses a local JSON dataset to simulate real-world weather data in a consistent and reliable way. This means the app remains stable and fully testable without worrying about API keys, rate limits, or network issues during assessment.

The main goals of this project are:

- To provide a simple, responsive, and accessible UI for viewing weather information.
- To demonstrate strong use of JavaScript, jQuery, and modular code structure.
- To showcase interactivity and user feedback through animations and error handling.
- To clearly meet the PP2 learning outcomes around UX, responsiveness, accessibility, and client-side logic.

I chose to build a weather app because it is a recognisable, practical concept that naturally combines:

- **User input and validation** (searching for cities).
- **Data handling** (mapping city names to structured weather data).
- **Dynamic UI updates** (showing and updating the weather card).
- **User experience considerations** (error handling, accessibility, responsiveness).

The original version of this project used the OpenWeatherMap API. For the resubmission, I decided to move to a local JSON dataset so that the app is fully deterministic and robust during assessment, while still demonstrating the same logical flow a real-weather app would use. This decision also shows that I can adapt the architecture of a project when requirements or constraints (such as not exposing API keys client-side) change.

From a learning perspective, this project gave me the opportunity to:

- Improve DOM manipulation skills with jQuery.
- Integrate a small animation library (GSAP) for tasteful, non-intrusive motion.
- Strengthen my understanding of accessibility and ARIA attributes.
- Practise structuring JavaScript into separate modules (`script.js`, `utils.js`, `animations.js`).

🛑 README NOTES 🛑

Do not add a **Table of Contents** to your Markdown files. GitHub has these built-in automatically using the headers/hashtags.

Don't add screenshots for the README/TESTING into your `assets` or `static` folders. Create a new folder at the root-level called `documentation`. Consider creating sub-directories within `documentation` to handle things like `wireframes`, `features`, `validation`, `responsiveness`, etc.

Learn about Markdown Alerts (aka Callouts), a fairly new feature for GitHub Markdown files.
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts
Note: these are not visible within your README Previewer, and are only visible once you push the code to GitHub.

## UX

### The 5 Planes of UX

#### 1. Strategy

**Purpose**
- Provide users with a quick, lightweight way to check weather information for major cities around the world.
- Offer a clean and focused interface that avoids clutter and prioritises readability.
- Demonstrate a realistic weather app workflow using a local dataset instead of a live API.

**Primary User Needs**
- Enter a city name and instantly see relevant weather information.
- Choose from common cities via quick-access buttons for convenience.
- Understand errors clearly if the city is not found in the dataset.
- Use the app comfortably on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

**Business Goals**
- Showcase a well-structured, accessible, and responsive front-end project.
- Demonstrate competence with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON data, and basic animation.
- Provide a solid portfolio piece that clearly meets the PP2 learning outcomes.

#### 2. Scope

**[Features](#features)** (see below)

**Content Requirements**
- Introductory “How it works” modal to explain the app’s purpose and usage.
- Search input for entering any city name.
- Quick-select city buttons for popular global cities.
- Weather information card displaying:
  - City name
  - Weather icon (emoji-based)
  - Temperature
  - Weather description
  - Wind speed
  - Last updated date/time
- Error messaging area for invalid or unavailable city searches.
- Sticky navbar and footer for a consistent frame.
- 404 page for non-existing routes.
- Subtle animations via GSAP to improve perceived responsiveness and feedback.

- Clear labels and instructions explaining how to search and what to expect.
- Informative error messages when a city cannot be found in the local dataset.
- Visible, well-structured weather information with clear hierarchy.
- Brief but useful text in the help modal to support first-time users.

#### 3. Structure

**Information Architecture**
- **Navigation Menu**:
  - Simple navbar with accessible links.
- **Hierarchy**:
  - Clear and prominent placement of the input fields and operator buttons.
  - Visible results area and error messages.

**User Flow**
1. User lands on the home page → reads brief instructions.
2. Inputs two numbers → selects an operator.
3. Sees instant results or an error message if input is invalid.
4. Views correct/incorrect equation feedback.
5. Starts fresh with the next calculation.

#### 4. Skeleton

**[Wireframes](#wireframes)** (see below)

#### 5. Surface

**Visual Design Elements**
- **[Colours](#colour-scheme)** (see below)
- **[Typography](#typography)** (see below)

### Colour Scheme

⚠️INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Explain your colors and color scheme. Consider adding a link and screenshot for your color scheme using [coolors](https://coolors.co/generate).

When you add a color to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your color palette later if needed. See example below:

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/080708-3772ff-df2935-fdca40-e6e8e6) to generate my color palette.

- `#000000` primary text.
- `#3772FF` primary highlights.
- `#DF2935` secondary text.
- `#FDCA40` secondary highlights.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)

### Typography

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like **Google Fonts**, **Font Awesome**, etc. Consider adding a link to each font used, the Font Awesome site (if used), or similar icon library.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.
- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

If you've created wireframes or mock-ups, use this section to display screenshots of your wireframes. The example table below uses sample pages from the walkthrough project to give you some inspiration for your own project, so please adjust accordingly.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

| Page | Mobile | Tablet | Desktop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## User Stories

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

In this section, list all of your possible user stories for the project. Samples have been provided below using the example walkthrough project for your inspiration. Make sure to adjust to match your own project features!

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

| Target | Expectation | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| As a user | I would like to input two numbers and select an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) | so that I can calculate a result. |
| As a user | I would like the application to show me an error message if I enter empty input (`NaN`) | so that I understand what went wrong. |
| As a user | I would like the calculation to happen instantly after I select an operator | so that I get my result quickly without waiting. |
| As a user | I would like the application to have clear and large buttons for each operator | so that I can easily select the correct one on any device. |
| As a user | I would like the application to have high-contrast colors and accessible fonts | so that I can easily read and interact with it. |
| As a user | I would like clear labels and instructions | so that I understand how to use the app without confusion. |
| As a user | I would like the app to show me the correct result if my equation was incorrect | so that I understand how the answer was calculated. |
| As a user |  I would like to see how many equations I get correct or incorrect | so I can push myself to improve my math skills. |
| As a user | I would like to see a 404 error page if I get lost | so that it's obvious that I've stumbled upon a page that doesn't exist. |

## Features

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each feature. You should explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on your target audience, what they want to achieve, and how your project can help them achieve these things.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember to always include a screenshot of each individual feature!

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

### Existing Features

| Feature | Notes | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operators | The mathematical operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) are large and colorful to allow users to easily select their preferred method of testing their calculation skills. Each operator is color-coded, and has the text name as well for easy identification. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/operators.png) |
| Equation | This section visibly displays the current equation to be calculated, dynamically updated to use the specific operator that the user has selected above. The empty `<input>` field allows users to enter valid numerical values to test their math skills. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/equation.png) |
| Submit Answer | This button allows user to submit their calculation to see if they've successfully answered the current equation. Users can also use the `[ENTER]` key on their keyboard to submit their answers, too. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/submit-answer.png) |
| Scores | This section tallies the total number of *correct* and *incorrect* answers that the user has calculated. Green to represent *correct*, and red to represent *incorrect*. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/scores.png) |
| Alerts | Depending on whether or not the user gets the calculation correct or incorrect, alerts are used to provide simple feedback to the user. This showcases if they got it correct, or if they've gotten it incorrect, therefore also showing the correct answer. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/alerts.png) |
| 404 | The 404 error page will indicate when a user has somehow navigated to a page that doesn't exist. This replaces the default GitHub Pages 404 page, and ties-in with the look and feel of the *Love Maths* site by using the standard navbar and footer. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/404.png) |

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

⚠️ TIP ⚠️

Consider adding screenshots of your Projects Board(s), Issues (open and closed), and Milestone tasks.

⚠️ --- END ---⚠️

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/KC-85/World-Wide-Weather-App/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/KC-85/World-Wide-Weather-App/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

| Link | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search/KC-85/World-Wide-Weather-App?query=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20-label%3Abug&label=Open%20Issues&color=yellow)](https://www.github.com/KC-85/World-Wide-Weather-App/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20-label%3Abug) | ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-open.png) |

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCoW" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features

## Testing

### Local VS Deployment

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to discuss any differences between the local version you've developed, and the live deployment site. Generally, there shouldn't be [m]any major differences, so if you honestly cannot find any differences, feel free to use the following example:

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

There are no remaining major differences between the local version when compared to the deployed version online.

## Credits

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

In the following sections, you need to reference where you got your content, media, and any extra help. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials (which is totally acceptable), however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid potential plagiarism.

⚠️ --- END ---⚠️

### Content

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to provide attribution links for any borrowed code snippets, elements, and resources. Ideally, you should provide an actual link to every resource used, not just a generic link to the main site. If you've used multiple components from the same source (such as Bootstrap), then you only need to list it once, but if it's multiple Codepen samples, then you should list each example individually. If you've used AI for some assistance (such as ChatGPT or Perplexity), be sure to mention that as well. A few examples have been provided below to give you some ideas.

Eventually you'll want to learn how to use Git branches. Here's a helpful tutorial called [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org) to bookmark for later.
